## Motivation:

- Beyond GDP, social variables and their convergence are relevant for development studies (Royuela et al 2015)

- Persistent income differences, differences in health indicators and in "general" regional inequality in Colombia. 

- Scarce academic literature on inequality (convergence approach) at the municipality level. 
  
## Research Objective:
  
- Study convergence/divergence of homicide rates and personal injury across municipalities and departments in Colombia 2010-2018 

- Analyze spatial autocorrelation and its robustness at different disaggregate levels

-Discuss policy implications of findings

  
## Methods:

- Classical convergence framework (Barro and Sala-i-Martin 1992)

- Distributional convergence framework (Quah 1996; Hyndman et. al 1996)

- Spatial autocorrelation (Moran's I)

# Data:

- Total number of homicides and personal injuries  in Colombia per year from 2010 until 2018 (data taken from the National police).

- Data is agreggated at the municipality  and departament level.

- Population census and estimates for states and municipalitites.

- Raw rates computed $$Hrate= homicides/population$$

- Survival rates (non- murder rates) computed　
   $$NMR= 10000- raw\ rate * 10000$$
- **Survival rates** are chosen because positively defined variables are a **standard** in the convergence literature.

# (4) Spatial Autocorrelation (moran I definition)

##**High Intuition Concept**

##More Formal (less intuitive)

$$I = \frac{\sum_i\sum_j w_{ij} z_i.z_j}{\sum_i z_i^2} = \frac{\sum_i (z_i \times \sum_j w_{ij} z_j)}{\sum_i z_i^2}.$$
 In the linear regression **y=α+βx**
, the estimate for 
**β**
is $\sum_i (x_i \times y_i) / \sum_i x_i^2$.In the Moran scatter plot shown below,  **y** is the spatial lag variable $\sum_j w_{ij} z_j$

![](figs/moran3.png)

##Differential Moran Scatter Plot ( $y_{i,t}−y_{i,t−1}$ )
Differencing the variable to control for the locational fixed effects: We computate the Moran's I  for the  variable 
$y_{i,t}−y_{i,t−1}$. If we consider there is a  fixed effect  $\mu_i$ related to location $i$, it is possible to present the value at each location for time $t$ as the sum of some intrinsic value and the fixed effect. $y_{i,t} = y*_{i,t} + \mu_i$ (Geoda documentation 2019)

# (4) Spatial autocorrelation 

1. **State level**: Moran's I statistic significant, differntial Moran's I is not significant (**not robust**)

2. **Municipality level**: Differential Moran's I significant  (**robust**)

# (4) Spatial autocorrelation 
## State level (not robust)

- Univatiate Moran's I is significant from 2012.
- But, **The differential moran statistic is not significant**. It is then considered that the significance of Spatial Autocorrelation is **not robust**.
- See plots for 2014 and 2014-2013, similar for other years (standarized variables)

![](figs/moranst.png)

# (4) Spatial autocorrelation 
## Municipality level  (**Robust**)

- The univariate Moran's  I is not significant in 2010 and 2011. however, it is significant from 2012 to  2018;  reaching a maximum value in 2016.
- Differential Moran's I ( $sur_{2018}-sur_{2010}$ ) is **significant** $Moran's\ I = 0.22^{***}$ 
- Subsequent Differential Moran's I $sur_{t}-sur_{t-1}$ **statistically significant at the municipality level**. Except 2014-2013 (not statistically significant) see graphs

#(4) Policy discussion 

vertical and horizontal policy coordiantion:

It could be more appropriate for the formulation of national development plans to have convergence targets at the state level as well as the municipal level

#(4) Policy discussion 

##The need for a spatial perspective in current cash transfer programs:
	
-  Spatial regressions could be used to test determinant hypothesis  
 
- Moreover, such research could contribute to the literature by suggesting a case for spatially focused CCTs. 
 
- Ultimately, this type of analysis could serve a as tool for combating organized crime in specific locations

# (5) Concluding Remarks

## Uplifting results  "on average" :

- Differences in overall raw rates at the state level **have decreased** and the means at both levels have increased (survival rate)

- **Global convergence on average at the state level**, while  fast beta convergence at the municipality level.

## Beyond classical convergence  :

- Regional differences matter in **both disaggreagation levels**.

- **Multiple local convergence clubs**; with more clubs at the state level.

## The Role of Space

- Subsequent Differential Moran's I are robust and significant at the **municipality level only**
- Results at the **state level** are not conlusive and similar to the ones reported by Royuela et al 2015.

# (5) Concluding Remarks

# Implications and further research

- Strong spatial autocorrelation suggest the posibility of applying the Getis filtering in order to filter the spatial component of homicide variables.  

- Convergence clusters help us to find regions with similar outcomes, coordination among them can be promoted.


- Has crime followed a trajectory? can a speed and direction of contagious patterns be found?

- At the state or department level (including more variables) can a probit model help us to find the determinants for a conditional "jump" to the upper clusters.

# Regional Disparities, Aggregation Effects and the Role of Space: Evidence from Homicide Rates in Colombia 2010-2018

### Felipe Santos and Carlos Mendez

### Abstract
This papers studies convergence and spatial autocorrelation of homicide rates in municipalities and departments in Colombia. Indicators of sigma convergence are found only at the state level. In contrast, at both levels significant beta coefficients were reported with different magnitudes. A distributional analysis approach also presents different patterns; at the department level four convergence clubs are found, while the conformation of at least two convergence clubs is present at the lower level. Lastly, robust spatial autocorrelation is found only at the municipality level. These results state the importance of the disaggregation level when studying convergence and the influence of neighboring spatial units. The findings of the distribution and spatial autocorrelation are milestones for further research andã€€indicate the possibility of applying spatial filtering techniques and other Spatial econometric tools in order to study patterns of social development and diffusion.
